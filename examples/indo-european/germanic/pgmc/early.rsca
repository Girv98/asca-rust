# Chain shift of the three series of plosives.
# Voiceless plosives become fricatives
# Voiced plosives are devoiced
# Aspirated plosives become voiced plosives or fricatives.

@ Verner's Law
    [-voice, +cont] > [+voice] / V:[-stress]([+son])_
# Voiceless fricatives are voiced when preceded by an unaccented vowel.
# Including cases where the vowel and fricative are separated by a sonorant.
