0.8.0
==================
[0.7.7...0.8.0](https://github.com/Girv98/asca-rust/compare/0.7.7...0.8.0)

Breaking:
* Lib:
    * Diacritic aliases are now preceded by `"` instead of `^` to remove ambiguity between `ʔ͡h` and `ʔʰ` which are now `?^h` and `?"h` respectively.
    * Removed dedicated americanist aliases in favour of custom aliasing. The following can be used as a replacement:
